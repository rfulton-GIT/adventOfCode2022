I'm still a novice in git and github, so here are a few reminders for myself.

1. If you never make changes to the remote repository, the workflow will be simpler.
2. make you changes as normal, and then when you want to update the remote repo,
3. navigate to the parent directory and type in the following commands:
4. git add .
5. git commit -m <message-in-quotes>
6. git branch (to ensure you're on the main branch)
7. git push -u origin main (I don't know what all this is but it works)
